# Upside Down
In this repository there is a platformer video game made by two second year students of the Videogame Design and Development degree.
The game has been made using C++ (using SDL and pugi libraires) and the maps have been created using Tiled.

## Innovation:
- Level_load: Instead of creating 2 scenes, we develop a Stuct Level with an Int (level) and a Sting (MapPath.tmx). So if the int is "1" the map loaded will be "map1.tmx".
